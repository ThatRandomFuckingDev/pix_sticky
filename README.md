A simple python text_editor, I haven't really put too much effort into developing it lately. But here, why not?

Note, you will need tkinter, so make sure you sudo apt install python3-tkinter (Been a while since I used Debian, forgive me),
it should be the same for Fedora, so sudo dnf install python3-tkinter, and for Arch, pacman -S python3-tkinter (I believe.)

I haven't coded in Python in a while, so, again, just forgive me.
